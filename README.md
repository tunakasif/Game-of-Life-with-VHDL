Summary of the project:
In this project, implementation of John Conway’s Game of Life is created on a FPGA board with VHDL. Despite the name, Game of Life is more like a simulation; user defines an initial condition which describes a cell population that will be simulated. No further input is needed to observe the consequences of the simulation. User defines an initial condition and observes how the system evolves. The rules of the simulation are determined by the Cambridge mathematician John Conway and these rules create a logical system for determining the fate of the cell population. Implementation of this logical system is handled by the FPGA board and the condition of the system is displayed on a monitor via VGA port of the board. For further information see the report specified in the repository, which you can find every detail about the project.
